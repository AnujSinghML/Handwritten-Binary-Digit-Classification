Made a sequential neural network using tenserflow to classify handwritten digits (binary).
The data for model training and prediction to check accuracy is in X.npy and y.npy - which is a subset of the MNIST handwritten digit dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
The images 1 and 2 show the output of the main program. (99.90% accuracy).
Comments in the code , explain everything.
